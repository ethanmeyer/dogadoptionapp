Josie,Poodle,"Josie came from a commercial breeder who was no longer going to use her for breeding. She is very shy and scared and requires a fence and another small social dog in the home. Dogs from commercial breeders are generally undersocialized, and probably never lived in a house. They need to learn things like how to walk on a leash, go up stairs, and what things like television is. She will need an adopter who will give her the time she needs to adjust and learn to trust people. Every baby step forward needs to be celebrated, and the dog needs to be accepted for who they are at each step. Some dogs can adjust quickly and learn how to be a loved pet pretty easily. Others take a long time to even be comfortable with things like walking through the house. No matter how far and how fast the breeder dogs progress, they are wonderful dogs and deserve a great home after being used the first part of their lives for making puppies. A fence (or at least a fenced in potty area) is highly recommended and may be required for certain dogs. Another small dog in the house can also help many former breeders adjust faster to life in a home.",,2,2,1,2,1,1
Poppy,Border Collie,"My name is Poppy. I was left in an overnight crop box at a high kill shelter in the midwest. I am what they call a saddle-back border collie in markings and color. I am very friendly and love attention. I am about 1-2 years old. I can co-exist with other dogs, but I can be a bit witchy. Doesn't make any difference if the dog is male or female. If there are other dogs in your house, I need a consistent and effective pack leader. I walk pretty good on a leash. If I get too far ahead, all you have to do is give me a little tap on the leash to remind me to stay back with you. I'm not a puller. I'm well mannered in the house and can settle down.",,3,3,3,1,1,0
Luna,Australian Shepherd,"Luna is a beautiful dog that just needs a little guidance. She is as sweet as she is smart, but don't be fooled! This girl knows how to wrap you around her paw! She needs a strong minded person to help her learn some boundaries and rules in life. I mean look at her, she's so pretty she's used to getting everything she wants when she wants it. She is housebroken and crate trained. She loves to run around and play and would probably do best in a home that was fairly active and/or had a yard. She is also one that should go through some training course to refine her behavior. She is very much a herding dog as well, so we do prefer to place her in a home with older kids only and possibly one with breed experience as well. Come meet Luna and fall in love with her active little personality. After you guys go for a four mile hike, she's down to binge on The Crown with you, or watch some hockey! ",,3,3,3,1,1,0
Doug,Laborador Retriever,"Doug is a purebred Golden Retriever beauty. He  is a bit wary of strangers, but warms up quickly and has learned to take treats from our hand. He will give you her paw when she wants more pets. Doug needs to be the only pet in he new home and any kids should be older and dog savvy. He would do best in a home that will give her all the loving he needs. He requires at least a 4 foot fence.",,3,2,2,1,1,1
Tucker,Corgi,"Hello. My name is Tucker. I am a 8 week old Corgi mix. I came to AFA from an ""overcrowded"" open door shelter. I am playful, fun and full of energy. I can't wait to meet my forever family! Please keep in mind when visiting with me - I AM A PUPPY. Puppies take a lot of time, work and patience. I'm already up to date on vaccinations, spayed, and also have a microchip. All I need now is someone like YOU to come adopt me!!",,2,1,1,0,1,0
Buddy,Jack Russell Terrier,"Meet Buddy! He is incredible! He is deaf but that bothers him none! He knows 9+ signs, is super smart, loves tennis balls, snuggles, tug of war, and going for walks! Iggy cannot live with other dogs or cats. He wants his people all to himself.Buddy has waited forever to find a home and we hope to find him a great home in the Pacific Northwest. Originating from Best Friends in Utah, we are so excited to have him here. His local coach has worked with many deaf dogs, curiously most have white coats. They are the best. He is now updated on all shots, neutered and will be chipped. His adopt fee is $395.",,2,1,2,0,1,1
